# Thread Safety in Multi-Stage Product Processing

## Synchronization Mechanisms

### Semaphores
- Control concurrent resource access
- Manage processing stages and buffer capacities

#### Semaphore Variables
- `assembly_machines`: Limit concurrent assembly (4 machines)
- `quality_machines`: Limit quality checks (3 machines)
- `packaging_machines`: Limit packaging (2 machines)
- `buffer1`: Manage first inter-stage buffer
- `buffer2`: Manage second inter-stage buffer

### Mutexes
- Protect critical sections during buffer modifications
- Prevent race conditions

#### Mutex Variables
- `m1`: Protect buffer1 during quality check stage
- `m2`: Protect buffer2 during packaging stage

## Thread Safety Challenges

### Without Mutexes
Potential race conditions could occur:
- Simultaneous buffer access
- Inconsistent semaphore manipulation
- Unpredictable thread interactions

### Critical Sections Protected

#### Quality Check Stage
```c
pthread_mutex_lock(&m1);     // Lock before buffer1 modification
sem_post(&buffer1);          // Release buffer1 slot
pthread_mutex_unlock(&m1);   // Unlock after modification
```

#### Packaging Stage
```c
pthread_mutex_lock(&m2);     // Lock before buffer2 modification
sem_post(&buffer2);          // Release buffer2 slot
pthread_mutex_unlock(&m2);   // Unlock after modification
```

## Synchronization Flow

1. **Assembly Stage**
   - Wait for available assembly machine
   - Process product
   - Wait for buffer1 space

2. **Quality Check Stage**
   - Acquire mutex for thread-safe buffer1 access
   - Wait for quality check machine
   - Process product
   - Wait for buffer2 space

3. **Packaging Stage**
   - Acquire mutex for thread-safe buffer2 access
   - Wait for packaging machine
   - Process product
   - Complete pipeline

## Key Synchronization Principles

- Controlled resource access
- Prevention of simultaneous critical section modifications
- Orderly progression through processing stages

## Mutex Purpose

The mutexes ensure:
- Atomic buffer slot management
- Prevention of data races
- Consistent inter-thread communication
- Predictable semaphore state modifications

## Potential Risks Without Mutexes

- Buffer corruption
- Semaphore count inconsistencies
- Unpredictable thread behavior
- Potential deadlocks or resource conflicts
