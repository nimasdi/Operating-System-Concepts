# Report: Improved Intersection Simulation

## Overview
This report compares two versions of an intersection simulation program for handling vehicle movements in a multi-directional intersection. The slow version uses a single global lock (`Intersection_lock`) for managing access to the intersection, while the improved version optimizes concurrency by using separate locks for each direction.

### Key Features:
- **Slow Version:**
  - Single mutex for the entire intersection.
  - All vehicles compete for the same lock, causing significant bottlenecks.

- **Improved Version:**
  - Separate mutexes for each direction (North, South, East, West).
  - Direction-specific locking reduces contention and improves concurrency.

## Changes in the Improved Version

### 1. **Direction-Specific Mutexes**
- Replaced the single `Intersection_lock` with four mutexes: `north_mutex`, `south_mutex`, `east_mutex`, and `west_mutex`.
- Each mutex controls access to vehicles originating from a specific direction, allowing simultaneous operations for non-conflicting movements.

### 2. **Safe Printing**
- Introduced a dedicated `print_mutex` to ensure thread-safe console output.
- Reduced potential interleaving of messages, improving readability.

### 3. **Optimized Logic for Vehicle Movements**
- Updated the `turn_right`, `go_straight`, and `turn_left` functions to lock only the mutex associated with the specific direction of the vehicle.
- Ensured proper unlocking after the movement simulation to avoid deadlocks.

### 4. **Performance Measurement**
- Added runtime calculation to measure the total simulation duration.

## Implementation Details
### Slow Version
The slow version locks the entire intersection for any vehicle movement:
```c
pthread_mutex_lock(&Intersection_lock);
// Simulate vehicle movement
pthread_mutex_unlock(&Intersection_lock);
```
This approach creates a bottleneck as only one vehicle can proceed at any time, even if their movements are independent.

### Improved Version
The improved version introduces fine-grained locking, as shown below:
```c
pthread_mutex_lock(&north_mutex);
// Simulate vehicle movement from North
pthread_mutex_unlock(&north_mutex);
```
Additionally, a dedicated `safe_print` function ensures proper synchronization for console outputs:
```c
void safe_print(const char *message) {
    pthread_mutex_lock(&print_mutex);
    printf("%s", message);
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&print_mutex);
}
```

### Code Snippets
#### Slow Version Example:
```c
void turn_right(int id, int direction) {
    pthread_mutex_lock(&Intersection_lock);
    printf("car with id %d with source %d is turning right\n", id, direction);
    sleep(rand() % MAX_SLEEP);
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&Intersection_lock);
}
```

#### Improved Version Example:
```c
void turn_right(int id, int direction) {
    pthread_mutex_t *dir_mutex = &north_mutex; // Example for North
    pthread_mutex_lock(dir_mutex);
    safe_print("car turning right from North\n");
    sleep(rand() % MAX_SLEEP);
    pthread_mutex_unlock(dir_mutex);
}
```

## Results
### Performance Comparison:
| Version         | Runtime (seconds)           |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|
| Slow Version    | ~84.5 seconds               |
| Improved Version| ~36.6 seconds               |

(the codes are run on a ubuntu 64-bit server ARM with 4 cores and 4 GiB of ram)

### Observations:
1. **Throughput:** The improved version allowed more vehicles to proceed simultaneously, especially those from independent directions.
2. **Scalability:** The modular locking mechanism can easily handle more complex scenarios, such as prioritization rules or additional directions.
3. **Readability:** Improved logging and thread-safe printing enhance debugging and monitoring.

## Conclusion
The improved version of the intersection simulation program significantly outperforms the slow version by optimizing concurrency and reducing contention. The enhancements lead to faster execution, better scalability, and cleaner console output.

### Future Improvements
- Implement traffic rules for prioritization (e.g., yielding).
- Add support for multi-lane intersections.
- Introduce dynamic car generation to simulate real-world traffic scenarios.
