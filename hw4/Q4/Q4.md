## Ensuring Safe Movement of Agents Using Locks in a Multithreaded Environment

This report examines the locking mechanisms used in the provided code to ensure that multiple agents navigating a shared map do not collide or cause data corruption. The approach primarily revolves around the use of a mutex (`pthread_mutex_t`) to synchronize access to shared resources, such as the `map`.

### Overview of the Problem

In this application:
1. Agents represented by threads traverse a shared grid (`map`) based on predefined paths.
2. The renderer thread continuously updates the console view of the map.
3. The primary challenge is to ensure that:
   - Agents do not overwrite each other’s positions.
   - The renderer displays a consistent view of the map.
   - Race conditions are avoided during concurrent access to the `map`.

### Locking Mechanism

A global mutex (`maplock`) is used to synchronize access to the shared `map`. This mutex ensures that only one thread (agent or renderer) can modify or read the `map` at a time.

#### Agent Movement
Each agent thread:
1. Locks the `maplock` mutex before:
   - Checking whether the target position is valid (e.g., within bounds and unoccupied).
   - Updating its current position on the `map`.
2. Unlocks the `maplock` mutex immediately after modifying the `map`.
3. Sleeps for one second after each movement to allow other threads to execute.

The step-by-step logic for an agent’s movement is as follows:
- Compute the target position based on the next instruction in its path.
- Acquire `maplock` to:
  - Verify the target position is unoccupied (`map[new_x][new_y] == '.'`).
  - Update the `map` by clearing the old position and marking the new position.
- Release the lock to allow other threads to proceed.

This approach ensures that two agents cannot simultaneously write to or check the same part of the `map`, preventing data corruption and collisions.

#### Renderer Updates
The renderer thread:
1. Locks `maplock` to compare the current state of the `map` with the previous state.
2. If changes are detected, the renderer:
   - Clears the console.
   - Prints the updated `map`.
   - Copies the current `map` to `prev_map`.
3. Unlocks the `maplock`.
4. Sleeps for one second to reduce overhead and provide a smooth visual update.

This ensures that the renderer always reads a consistent state of the `map` and avoids partial updates caused by concurrent modifications.

### Key Considerations

1. **Thread Safety:**
   - The use of `maplock` ensures that only one thread can access the `map` at a time, avoiding race conditions.
   - Both agent and renderer threads adhere to a strict lock-acquire-modify-unlock pattern, maintaining consistency.

2. **Fairness:**
   - The `sleep(1)` calls in both agents and the renderer allow other threads to acquire the lock, reducing the likelihood of starvation.

3. **Scalability:**
   - The global lock (`maplock`) simplifies synchronization but may become a bottleneck if the number of agents is significantly increased. A more granular locking mechanism (e.g., one lock per grid cell) could improve performance for larger maps or higher numbers of agents.

4. **Deadlock Prevention:**
   - The code avoids deadlocks by ensuring that each thread acquires and releases `maplock` in a consistent manner. No nested locks are used, reducing complexity.

5. **Error Handling:**
   - Proper initialization and destruction of `maplock` prevent resource leaks.
   - Dynamic memory allocations for `map` and agent paths are correctly freed at the end of the program.

### Limitations

1. **Global Lock Overhead:**
   - Since all threads contend for a single lock, contention increases as the number of threads grows.

2. **Fixed Sleep Time:**
   - The `sleep(1)` approach may not be optimal for high-performance applications.

3. **Path Validation:**
   - The code assumes paths are valid and does not handle edge cases like agents attempting to move out of bounds or onto blocked cells.

### Additional Questions

#### 1. Can we devise an algorithm to detect deadlock before the simulation starts, based on the problem configuration?
Yes, it is possible. Analyzing the initial positions and paths of agents can help identify potential conflicts. For example:
- Construct a graph where nodes represent positions on the map and directed edges represent the movement between positions based on agent paths.
- Use cycle detection algorithms (like Tarjan’s or DFS-based approaches) to identify circular dependencies, which could indicate deadlocks.
- If cycles are detected, revise the configuration or introduce rules to prevent the corresponding movements.

#### 2. If a deadlock occurs during the simulation, can an algorithm resolve it by changing agent paths?
Yes, resolving deadlocks dynamically is feasible. The steps could include:
- Detecting the deadlock: Identify agents that are unable to proceed due to mutual blocking.
- Adjusting paths: Recompute alternate paths for blocked agents using algorithms like A* or Dijkstra’s to bypass the deadlock region.
- Priority rules: Introduce a priority mechanism where higher-priority agents proceed first, forcing lower-priority agents to wait or reroute.
- Conflict resolution: Allow agents to backtrack to their previous positions and attempt alternate paths.

#### 3. Does changing the thread priority of an agent affect its movement speed? Assume a single-core system.
Yes, on a single-core system, thread priority influences the CPU scheduler’s decision on which thread to execute next. A higher-priority thread will:
- Receive more CPU time compared to lower-priority threads.
- Appear to move faster since it spends less time waiting to execute.
However, this approach can lead to starvation of lower-priority threads if not managed carefully. Using time-slicing or balanced priority adjustments can mitigate this issue.
