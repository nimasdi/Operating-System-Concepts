# Threaded Network Communication Mechanism

## System Architecture

### Core Components
- Circular Buffer: Shared communication channel
- Senders: 3 threads generating packets
- Consumers: 2 threads processing packets

## Synchronization Techniques

### Circular Buffer Management
- Mutex-protected access
- Fixed-size (5 packet) buffer
- Thread-safe insertion/removal
- Prevents race conditions

### Acknowledgment Mechanism
- Per-sender condition variables
- Timed wait for acknowledgments
- Timeout handling (5 seconds)

## Communication Workflow

1. **Sender Process**
   - Generate unique packet
   - Attempt buffer insertion
   - Wait for acknowledgment
   - Handle timeout scenarios

2. **Consumer Process**
   - Extract packet from buffer
   - Process packet
   - Send acknowledgment
   - Signal waiting sender

## Key Synchronization Primitives

- `pthread_mutex_t`: Protect shared resources
- `pthread_cond_t`: Coordinate thread communication
- `pthread_cond_timedwait()`: Implement timeout mechanism

## Potential Scenarios

- Buffer overflow handling
- Packet acknowledgment
- Timeout management
- Concurrent thread interactions

## Design Characteristics

- Non-blocking communication model
- Simulated network transmission
- Randomized processing times
- Robust error handling

## Concurrency Challenges Addressed

- Race condition prevention
- Resource contention management
- Synchronized communication
- Timeout and error scenarios
