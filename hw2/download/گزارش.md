### 1. File Writing Callback

```c
size_t write_data(void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, FILE *stream)
```

- Handles writing downloaded data to files
- Called by libcurl when data is received
- Wrapper around fwrite for streaming downloads

### 2. Download Function

```c
void download_file(const char *url, const char *output_filename)
```

- Manages single file download using libcurl
- Sets up file handling and curl options
- Handles cleanup and error reporting
- Creates output file in binary write mode

### Main Process Logic

- Reads URLs from input file line by line
- Creates child processes for each download
- Parent process waits for all downloads to complete
- Limits maximum downloads to 100 (MAX_URLS)
