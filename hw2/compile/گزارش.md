# C Source Code Compiler and Runner

This program does the below steps:

- Accepting a source file path as input
- Changing to the source file's directory
- Compiling the code using GCC
- Executing the compiled program

## Logic

We first use `fork()` for creating a process, then figure out the address and create the compile command. Then we use `system()` for compilation. After we successfully compiled the code, we create a process and in it use `execlp()` for execution of the compiled code.

## Process Flow

CopyInput Source File → Change Directory → Compile → Execute → Return Result
