## Overview

This program first traverses all the directories and files, adding them to their own linked lists. This approach has some advantages:

1. **Dynamic Thread Count**: There is no fixed limit on the number of threads that can be created. The program dynamically allocates threads based on the number of files and directories identified during the traversal, making efficient use of system resources.

2. **Parallel Processing**: After traversing the directory structure, the program assigns each file and directory its own thread for copying.

## Functions

### 1. Directory Traversal

```c
void traverseDirectory(const char *srcDir, const char *destDir)
```

- Recursively walks through source directory
- Builds separate linked lists for files and directories
- Skips "." and ".."
- Adds entries to appropriate lists using `addFileToList` or `addDirToList`

### 2. List Management Functions

#### File List Addition

```c
void addFileToList(const char *srcPath, const char *destDir)
```

- Adds new file entry to file linked list
- Increments file counter

#### Directory List Addition

```c
void addDirToList(const char *srcPath, const char *destDir)
```

- Adds new directory entry to directory linked list
- Increments directory counter

### 3. Threading Operations

#### Directory Creation Thread

```c
void *createDirThread(void *arg)
```

- Creates single directory with 0755 permissions
- Executed in parallel for all directories

#### File Copy Thread

```c
void *copyFileThread(void *arg)
```

- Copies single file using buffer-based I/O
- 4KB buffer size for efficient copying
- Handles file permissions and error cases

### 4. Operations

#### Directory Creation

```c
void createAllDirectories()
```

- Creates threads for all directories
- Waits for all directory creations to complete
- Manages thread allocation and cleanup

#### File Copying

```c
void copyAllFiles()
```

- Creates threads for all files
- Waits for all file copies to complete
- Manages thread allocation and cleanup

## Program Flow

1. **Directory Analysis**
   - Traverses source directory structure
   - Builds lists of files and directories

2. **Directory And File Creation**
   - Creates all required directories in parallel
   - Ensures directory structure exists before file copying
   - Copies all files in parallel
   - Uses buffered I/O for efficient copying
